4. Better margins.
5. Better use of accent colors, which change with your Anilist settings. (Currently problems with Firefox)

## 🦊 For Firefox users
The accent colors won't work with your default Browser settings. You can fix this by opening "about:config" and setting the "layout.css.has-selector.enabled" flag to true. Here a step-by-step tutorial:
1. In your Firefox adress bar search for "about:config".
2. Accept the disclaimer.
3. Now search for "layout.css.has-selector.enabled" in the search box that appeared.
4. Activate the flag (set it to "true") with a double click.
5. Close the "about:config" tab and go to your [Anilist](https://anilist.co/) profile page.
8. Everything should work properly from now on. If you need help just open an issue.
