4. New "activity delete" window.
5. New design for "Filter" dropdown menu on profile pages.
6. Last elements updated with new design.

## üåü Features
1. Removes all scrollbars on Anilist. (Chromium)
2. New design for various elements.
3. New border radii for screen elements.
4. Better margins.
5. Better use of accent colors, which change with your Anilist settings. (Currently problems with Firefox)

## ü¶ä Firefox color issue
There is a compatibility issue with Firefix at the moment. The accent colors are not displayed correctly. Normaly you can fix this by opening "about:config" and setting the "layout.css.has-selector.enabled" flag to true, but this feature is broken and won't fix the problem. Firefox is currently working on a solution, so we have to wait. If you still want a soloution that kinda works you can try the following:
1. In your Firefox adress bar search for "about:config".
2. Accept the disclaimer.
3. Now search for "layout.css.has-selector.enabled" in the search box that appeared.
4. Activate the flag (set it to "true") with a double click.
5. Now go to your [Anilist](https://anilist.co/) profile page.
6. Hover over an activity entry and click on the three dots that appear on the top right.
7. Click "Delete" and than cancel it with the "Cancel" button.
8. Now everything should work until your reload the Page. You have to repeat step 5-7 every time when you reload the page.
